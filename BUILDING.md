# Building with CMake

## Build

This project doesn't require any special command-line flags to build to keep
things simple.

Here are the steps for building in release mode with a single-configuration
generator, like the Unix Makefiles one:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

Here are the steps for building in release mode with a multi-configuration
generator, like the Visual Studio ones:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```
